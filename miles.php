			<h2>Clinical Trials Need You</h2>
			<p>Clinical trials are the final phase in the lengthy drug development process. They are a critical and required step to speed cures. But a persistent shortage of volunteers for clinical trials slows scientific progress. Patients pay the ultimate price for underenrollment in clinical research, facing few new treatment options.</p>

					<h3>Recruitment Challenges</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							30% of all clinical trials fail to recruit a single person
						</li>
						<li>
							85% of clinical trials face delays due to limited participation
						</li>
						<li>
							Fewer than 10% of Parkinson's patients ever take part in trials, despite overwhelming interest in working with scientists to help speed treatment breakthroughs
						</li>
					</ul>

				<div data-role="collapsible" data-iconpos="right" data-inset="false" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="d">
					<h3>Types of Trials</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							There are many different types of Parkinson’s trials, including ones that test new drug compounds and devices (interventional trials) , ones that aim to better understand the disease (observational trials), and tests of non-pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture, exercise and even video gaming
						</li>
						<li>
							Fewer than half of all trial participants ever receive a placebo
						</li>
					</ul>

				<div data-role="collapsible" data-iconpos="right" data-inset="false" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="d">
					<h3>Volunteer Rights</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Participating in a trial should not interfere with your usual care
						</li>
						<li>
							As a volunteer, you are protected by the patient’s bill of rights that allows you to end your participation in the trial at any point
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>How Fox Trial Finder Works</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fox Trial Finder (FTF) is a user-friendly Web site that connects volunteers with clinical trials.
						</li>
						<li>
							The tool suggests trial matches that need someone specifically like you. It even alerts you when new trials that may be matches are added.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can be matched to trials by answering as few as three questions, though the more information you provide, the better your results will be.
						</li>
						<li>
							Your privacy is protected by industry-standard security protocols.
						</li>
						<li>
							You don’t have to have Parkinson’s disease to sign up — many trials need control participants. Spread the word to your friends and family!
						</li>
						<li>
							Help us reach 15,000 FTF registrations and empower yourself to help speed Parkinson’s disease breakthroughs.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h3>What happens when a trial is over?</h3>
						<p>
							Once a clinical trial is over, the trial team assesses the data, distills key findings, publishes or presents any novel findings and determines the appropriate next steps for future testing, as appropriate. They may continue to evaluate the treatment in the next trial or discontinue research because the treatment has not been shown to be safe or effective. In some cases, if the treatment continues to the next phase, trial participants will be given the option of participating in that phase of the study as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							The FDA requires that trial results be published in a scientific or medical journal and made available to the public within 12 months of the last participant’s visit.* However, because it is hard for the FDA to track and enforce these regulations, it can be difficult to learn about trial results. Volunteers can search the Web or follow up with the trial team to inquire about study outcomes.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h3>How are volunteer rights and my safety protected in a trial?</h3>
						<p>
							Clinical research is subject to federal regulations, many of which focus on the safety of the participants in a trial. Every trial follows an extensive and carefully monitored protocol. The protocol is a detailed plan that describes the study process. In addition to the protocol, each study has a consent form (also sometimes referred to as informed consent or consent to participate) that volunteers must read and sign before joining the study. The consent form will explain rights and responsibilities as a volunteer and what to expect during the study. Study protocols and consent forms must be reviewed and approved by a regulatory body before any volunteers can be approached about or recruited into a study to ensure that the study is safe, ethical and appropriate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Trial team members will discuss the consent form and any aspects of the protocol in detail during a trial screening visit. Volunteers can also request a copy of the consent form to review it in advance of this in-person visit.

						<h3>What types of trials are there?</h3>
						<p>
							There are two main types of clinical trials - observational and interventional:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Observational clinical trials do not test drugs or treatments. Researchers observe participants by monitoring their health over a period of time. These studies provide researchers with data that advances our understanding of Parkinson’s and how to treat the disease.
								</li>
								<li>
									Interventional clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of a candidate drug, therapy or experimental treatment.
								</li>
								<li>
									Within these broad categories, trials also can be classified as follows:
								</li>
								<li>
									Treatment trials test treatments, drug combinations or surgical approaches to alleviate symptoms and/or slow disease progression in people with PD.
								</li>
								<li>
									Prevention trials test approaches, medicines, vitamins, minerals, vaccines or lifestyle changes that may lower the risk of developing PD.
								</li>
								<li>
									Screening trials test ways to detect PD, particularly in its early stages.
								</li>
								<li>
									Quality of Life trials explore ways to improve comfort and quality of life for patients with PD.
								</li>
								<li>
									Genetics trials are designed to improve the ability to look for an inherited risk of PD.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Trial team members will discuss the consent form and any aspects of the protocol in detail during a trial screening visit. Volunteers can also request a copy of the consent form to review it in advance of this in-person visit.
